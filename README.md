# Tech Test

A Simple iOS App in Swift 3

## Home Coding Exercise

This is my attempt at programming this excercise.  

### Task:

Edge5 â€“iOS Tech Test Home Coding Exercise

   * The purpose of this assessment is to complete a simple programming assignment by developing an iOS app.  
   * Deliverables: Full set of development artefacts, which enables review and execution in a simulator.  
   * In creating the app, pay attention to memory management, performance, code quality, testability,
maintainability of the code.   
   * Commit this app to Github.com and then send us a link to the repository.  
   * It should be simple to navigate the project, the structure of the project should be obvious, and the
purpose of the files self-explanatory.  


### Requirements:  

Write a mobile application and associated unit tests that can price a basket of goods in a number of
different currencies.
   * The goods that can be purchased, which are all priced in US$, are:
      * Tomatoes : $ 0,95 per bag  
      * Eggs : $ 2,10 per dozen  
      * Milk : $ 1,30 per bottle  
      * Beans : $ 0,73 per can 
   * The program shall allow the user to add or remove items in a basket. The user can click on a checkout button, which will then display the total price for the basket with the option to display the amount in different currencies. For example, if the basket contained milk and the currency selected was EUR with an exchange rate of 1.1, the total would be 1.43 EUR. 
   * No UI design constraints are enforced so feel free to design the UI in the way you see as most appropriate for the solution.  
   * To convert to other currencies, you will need to create an account on http://jsonrates.com/. This will then issue you with an API-Key that permits reading from the various public APIs listed on their site. The exchange rates may change at any time.
